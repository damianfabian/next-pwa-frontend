# Authentication

Here you can find an explication of how the Authentication process works on this App and 
how is the workflow to be login and logout. If you have any question or there is something 
wrong in this documentation please submit an issue.

## Stack

This App use firebase as the single Authentication source of true. But apart from that we are using
other technologies, below you can see the list that compose the Authentication module:

- Firebase: Firestore Auth module
- Nookies: Cookie manager to communicate the token to NextJS
- NextJS ServerSideProps: Checking before the page is even render if the user is Auth, if we are using
this props, means the page should not be visible for non-authenticated users.
- Auth Custom Hook: Custom hook that create a listener for onAuthStateChanged to logout the user in case
his token expire or the user choose to logout.

## Description

The Authentication is really simple, we use Firebase for Authentication and fom that point we have 2 ways
for checking if the user is authenticated or not. One way is before rendering a page, in that case that
validation happens on Backend. The other ways is during the execution on the client, in case the user
lost his token or choose to logout.

### Why do we have 2 ways of checking?

Basically we don't want the user to go to a page, start rendering and then redirect him to login. This will
happen if we only use the client validation. In the other case, if we only use backend validation, if the
user lost his token after login, this event won't be possible to check till the user moves to another page.

Because of this we decided to have 2 validations in place, the downside of this so far is that we have to 
use serverSideProps in each page as currently NextJS does not allow serverSideProps on _page.

## Workflow

Below you will find how the data goes for a successfull authentication flow:

1- User open the website.
2- We check on Backend if there is a valid token, if not, redirect him to Login.
3- If the user login in, then we ask for a token and save in cookies for future use.
4- Next time the user navigate to another page, we will check that token and let him pass.
5- In case his token expired or the user decided to logout, we remove the cookie.
6- There is a listener always listening to changes on the Authentication model from Firebase, if the
user lost his token, the listener will clean his connection and redirect him to Login.
